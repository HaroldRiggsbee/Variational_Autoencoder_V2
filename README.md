Variational Autoencoder for Kick Drums - Version 2

This project started as an initial curiosity about whether sounds could be recreated using neural networks. In doing research, I came across the concept of variational autoencoders. Initially used to recreate images, they were quickly surpassed in quality and scope by GANs and diffusion models. After doing research on YouTube, I came across a Medium article where a grad student had used VAEs to recreate spectrograms. While his initial push did not yield great results, in the 5 years that had passed since the article was written and I came across it, multiple Python libraries such as Librosa had made this task worth taking a second look at. I focused on kick drums because of their simplicity: they are in essence just sine waves that start with a sharp high-frequency transient which decompresses to create a lower-frequency tone.

This is version two. Initially it was all inside of one Google Colab notebook, but now is extended to several documents (while still using a Colab file to interact with cloud-based GPUs for training). My goal is to transition from 2D spectrograms to 1D real-time audio input to create sounds in the moment.
